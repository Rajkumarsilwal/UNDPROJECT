### `npm install`
Installs all project dependencies listed in package.json.
Run this once after cloning or setting up the project.
If there is an issue with webpack, then we need to manually adjust the configuration and install the dependencies

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
- Outputs static files to the **`dist/`** folder.
- Optimizes the build (minifies code, generates hashed asset filenames).

### `Notes:`
The project uses a custom **Webpack configuration** (not Create React App).
- You can modify `webpack.config.js` to customize output paths, loaders, environment variables, and plugins.
